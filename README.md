# 3D-SolarSystem
I have created a 3D solar system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The planets circle around their orbits, creating a realistic motion effect.
The project also includes moon orbiting around Earth, adding more depth to the simulation.
I built this without using any external libraries, focusing purely on core web technologies to achieve the 3D effect and animations.
